# Hex Clock
This is my altered version of [Hex clock](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/) by [Jacopo Colò](http://www.jacopocolo.com/).

I wanted a version I could use as a screen saver via [WebViewScreenSaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver). I also needed the text to scale well to different screen orientations, since I use both horizontal and vertical screens.  
Also, it's a PWA, so you can totally "install" it on your Android phone if you feel like that's something you would ever want to do.

Thank you to Jacopo Colò for creating the original Hex Clock and for letting me put this project up here!
